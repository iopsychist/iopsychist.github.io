								<h2>Talent Acquisition Process Framework</h2>
								<h5>

								<p>A good recruiter will find strong candidates. At scale, however, an organization cannot simply rely on good recruiters to fill its open positions in a reliable, time bound manner. Moreover, doing so would make it difficult to consistently incorporate hiring times into corporate planning.</p>
								<p>To make Talent Acquisition a part of your organizations strategic advantage, an effective Talent Acquisition Process <em>Framework</em> must be implemented.</p>
								<p> <b>Business Case:</b><br>
								The key tenets are visibility and traceability. Good data in good data out</p>
								<p>Like any human process, the recruitment process for any company is--at its core--uncertain. The hiring team attempts to use incomplete information on the candidate's past experience, current knowledge, dispositional traits, and future potential. The sources of this information may have varying degrees of accuracy and reliability. The candidate may exhibit different levels of performance during the interview process for reasons outside the awareness of the hiring team -- whether due to stress at the current job, activity in their personal life, even for such reasons of poor sleep or a bad commute. Furthermore, the hiring team is relying on estimates of future need to assess the potential fit of the candidate. Each of these guesses, estimates, and inferences open the door to uncertainty, bias, and error. Even if recruitment has gone well for a position whereby the team has accurately defined their needs, sourced quality candidates, and effectively narrowed in on the strongest candidate, the candidate may not choose to ultimately join the company. </p>
								<p>The goal of a strong recruitment process is to minimize the noise associated with the selection process and to maximize the likelihood that the selected candidate chooses to join the company. In the face of such uncertainty, the process itself should not add to noise in the overall system. Rather, it should open a window to the signals that will allow the astute observer to understand the activity within their practices.</p>
								<p>In an organization with multiple open positions and multiple team members supporting recruiting, this means standardization of practices. The actions of one recruiter should align with the actions of another. The milestones for one job should not differ substantially from the milestones of another. Failing to do this is costly. What happens when one recruiter gets sick, takes vacation, or leaves the organization? How does their coworker jump in and know what's going on? If there is no understanding of metrics, how does the organization know where to put its resources? If there is no sense of time to hire, how does the team know whether they are outperforming the market or not? If new hires are not succeeding in the position, how does the company know where the function is broken in order to make changes? The standardization discussed above allows for good data to be captured on all parts of the process, thus opening a window to answer these questions. You may be collecting such data already, but without this standardization what does time to hire mean, in aggregate, across your organization? Is it one day because you only add candidates into the system once they've completed all interviews and you want to make an offer? Is it 120 days because you sometimes don't bother marking them as hired since you'd rather get started with their onboarding than make a quick clerical adjustment to the system? What if your ATS tells you that 65% of your hires come from LinkedIn Job Postings, your most expensive vendor, when really you haven't captured source details for 50% of your top performing hires? Do you invest more in LinkedIn and hope to get top performers? Or do you go with you gut and invest in job fairs since you have a feeling that your best hires came through your college recruiting efforts? That's a tough call, and it doesn't need to be if you consistently practice good data hygiene.</p>
